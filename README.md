# Mnist Raspberry Pi classifier

This project is simple and incomplete MNIST classifier that works on Raspberry Pi 4, uses smartphone as an IP camera via WiFI network, Flask as webinterface to view video, and OpenCV to manipulate and establish video-stream.

Due to poor video preprocessing classification is not in the state of the art condition, but achieved good results.
